# DevStation

## NOTE
You will need a network connection for this installer to work.

## What will this disc do?
This disc is meant to install the build env, along with the dev env, into `/thinstation`. It will install a bootable TS image onto the hard drive and make this workstation a PXE boot server.

## Do I really need this?
Strictly speaking, no. You can git clone on Fedora or possibly RHEL with,  
`git clone --depth 1 git://github.com/Thinstation/thinstation.git`

## What else do I need?
If you want to boot clients from this workstation, you will need to assign a static IP to the MAC address of this workstation on your DHCP Server. You will also need to set the 'Next Server' for your network to that IP and set the boot file to `boot/grub2/pxeboot.img`.

## How do I build a thinclient?
After the installation has finished and you have rebooted, open an xterm and do the following  
`cd /thinstation`  
`./setup-chroot`  
`stb`  

This will make a thinclient that will boot on VMware workstations.

## How do I change the kind of image I want to make?  
Use your favorite editor to modify  
`/build/build.conf`  
and  
`/build/thinstation.conf.buildtime`.

## Is there any more documentation or help?  
Yes, check  
`/build/conf`  
and the wiki at  
`https://github.com/Thinstation/thinstation/wiki`  
or the general mailing list  
`https://lists.sourceforge.net/mailman/listinfo/thinstation-general`  
or the developer mailing list
